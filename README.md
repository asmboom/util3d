# util3d

`util3d` is a collection of C modules and headers implementing useful functions for programmers working with 3D graphics in OpenGL. This code is made available under the terms of the [MIT/X11 License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) and is free for any and all uses.

-   [`math3d`](math3d) &mdash; Implements a right-handed 3D mathematics library supporting three-component vectors, four-by-four matrices, quaternions, and Euler angles.

-   [`demo`](demo) &mdash; Implements a very simple framework for OpenGL demonstration applications.

-   [`image`](image) &mdash; Provides a basic image I/O library supporting the reading and writing of PNG, TIFF, JPEG, and OpenEXR images.

-   [`cube`](cube) &mdash; Renders the [3D reference cube](cube.pdf) using OpenGL. Useful for testing 3D transformations and debugging OpenGL applictions.

-   [`obj`](obj) &mdash; Loads, manipulates, optimizes, renders, and stores 3D geometry using the Wavefront OBJ file format.

-   [`glsl`](glsl) &mdash; Manages GLSL shader source and program objects.

-   [`type`](type) &mdash; Renders text using OpenGL. Useful for adding GUI elements and labels to 3D graphics applications.

-   [`noise`](noise) &mdash; Implements a 3D coherent noise generator using the Simplex method of Ken Perlin.

-   [`plane`](plane) &mdash; Renders a simple 3D plane using OpenGL.Useful as a basic scene backdrop.
